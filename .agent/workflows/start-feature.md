🚀 Start New Feature Workflow

Analyze Roadmap:

Read the file .agent/planning/active-roadmap.md.

Identify the current active phase and the next unchecked item.

Ask the user to confirm if this is the task they want to work on.

Create Branch:

Based on the task, suggest a branch name following the git-standards.md rule (e.g., feat/setup-multer).

Run the git checkout command.

Contextualize:

Explain briefly the technical plan to implement that specific task based on the pixelforge-core.md architecture.

Ready to Code:

Ask the user: "Shall we start coding the implementation now?"
